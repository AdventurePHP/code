 * @class ApplicationSingleton
 * @static
 *
 * Implements the generic application singleton pattern. Can be used to create singleton objects from
 * every class. This eases unit tests, because explicit singleton implementations cause side
 * effects during unit testing.
 * <p/>
 * Application singleton objects remain valid throughout multiple requests and sessions and only loose
 * their validity when the web server is restarted.
 * <p/>
 * Usage:
 * <pre>$instance = &ApplicationSingleton::getInstance('VENDOR\..\Class');</pre>
